    "### 1. Performance Optimization in PySpark\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:**\n",
    "- Spark executes jobs as a DAG of stages and tasks. Understanding this helps you optimize your code.\n",
    "- Avoid wide transformations (like groupBy, join) when possible, as they cause shuffles.\n",
    "- Use partitioning to distribute data evenly and avoid data skew.\n",
    "- Use predicate pushdown and column pruning by filtering and selecting only needed columns early.\n",
    "- Use `broadcast()` joins for small tables to avoid shuffles.\n",
    "- Cache or persist DataFrames only when reused multiple times.\n",
    "- Monitor jobs using the Spark UI to identify bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Syntax (Generic):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast\n",
    "# Broadcast join\n",
    "joined_df = df1.join(broadcast(df2), df1.key == df2.key)\n",
    "# Cache DataFrame\n",
    "df.cache()\n",
    "# Filter early for predicate pushdown\n",
    "df = df.filter(df.col1 > 0).select(\"col1\", \"col2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice:**\n",
    "- Identify a wide transformation in your pipeline and suggest an optimization.\n",
    "- Broadcast join `products_df` to `order_items_df` if products is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:**\n",
    "- Optimized code and explanation.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. Best Practices for PySpark Data Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:**\n",
    "- Use columnar formats like Parquet or ORC for efficient storage and processing.\n",
    "- Define schemas explicitly for better performance and data quality.\n",

    "from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType\n",
    "schema = StructType([StructField(\"col1\", StringType(), True)])\n",

    "# Example of modular code\n",
    "def clean_data(df):\n",
    "    return df.dropDuplicates().dropna()\n",
    "```\n",
